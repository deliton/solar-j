# SOLAR - J

This project was made to deepen my knowledge of Java GUI and Factory Design Pattern. Solar-J is a visual representation of the solar system, containing the Sun and all 8 planets. Although the arrangement of the planets are accurate, the correct distance betweem them and the size of the planets are unrealistic.

## Factory Method

In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor. 

## How to use it
