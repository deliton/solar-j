# SOLAR - J

This project was made to deepen my knowledge of Java GUI and Factory Design Pattern. Solar-J is a visual representation of the solar system, containing the Sun and all 8 planets. Although the arrangement of the planets are accurate, the correct distance betweem them and the size of the planets are unrealistic.
